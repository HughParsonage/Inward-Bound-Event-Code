  \section{Dictionary}
  \defi{Inward Bound} means the yearly competition\\[12pt]
  \defi{the event} means the particular competition of each year\\[12pt]
  \defi{ex-resident} has the same meaning as in the Interhall Sports Organisation by-laws.\\[12pt]
  The event is a competition between groups of runners from separate halls and colleges of the ANU. Each hall and college is called a \defi{residence}.\\[12pt]
  Each runner is called a \defi{competitor}; each group of four runners is called a \defi{team}; and the collection of all \competitor s from a \residence\ is called the \defi{squad} of the \residence.
  \\[12pt]
  %Hence, the term \defi{subset} may be used to describe a \competitor\ within a \team, or a \team\ within a %\squad, etc. \defi{Superset} is the symmetric term.\\[12pt]
  \defi{affiliated residence}, in relation to an offender, means the offending \residence\ or the \residence\ of the \Captain\ who entered the offending \competitor, \team, or \squad, or the \residence\ of the \President\ of the offending \spectator.

  \begin{fenumerate}
\item  The event consists of seven \defi{Division}s, with Division 1 being the most difficult and Division 7 being the least difficult.
\item Each residence may field one and only one \team\ in each Division.
\end{fenumerate}

  %  \item The event is a competition between groups of teams from separate halls and colleges of the ANU (``\defi{residence}s of the ANU'')
  %  \item Each \residence\ may field one group of four runners to compete in each Division.
  %  \item Each runner is called  a \defi{competitor}; each group is called a \defi{team}; and the collection of all \competitor s from a %\residence\ is called the \defi{squad} of that \residence.
  %  \item A residence may not field more than one \team\ in a single Division.

  \item[] In this chapter, the term \defi{significant training run} refers to:
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item training runs commonly known as ``mock IBs'' and
   \item any training run satisfying at least two of the following criteria:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the run starts or finishes at a place outside ANU,
    \item road vehicles are intended to be used to transport runners,
    \item any part of the run takes place west of the Murrumbidgee River, outside the ACT, or otherwise outside the Canberra metropolitan area,

      \Penalty{12 point penalty for \residence\ (No maximum for aggravated offence)}
  \item It is an aggravating factor to an offence under subsection \thesection(1) if the failure to notify was intended to harm the ability of the \Referee\ to make a successful prosecution.

      \eg{A \Coach\ fails to notify because he believes a runner may enter a prohibited area, and he does not want the \Referee\ to be able to identify the residence responsible if a complaint is made.}

    \note{To remove doubt, it is not a defence to \thesection(1) that the \Coach\ was unaware of the training run (such as being a spontaneous run by a \team)}

    \item The \Referee\ shall have the power to:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item conduct searches of \competitor s,
      \item interview \competitor s, \spectator s, and other officials, including the \RaceDirector, and
      \item access and inspect official records of the event.

  \section{Penalty for uncooperative conduct}

  \chapter{Principles}
  \section{Burden of proof}
  \begin{fenumerate}\item
  The \Referee\ bears the burden of proving every element of an offence relevant to the guilt of the accused.
  \item If a \Captain\ or \President, on behalf of the accused, wishes to rely on an exemption created by this Code, he or she bears the burden of proving every element of the exemption.
  \end{fenumerate}
  \section{Standard of proof}
    \begin{fenumerate}\item
  A burden of proof, whether on the \Referee\ or on the accused, is to be discharged on the balance of probabilities.\end{fenumerate}
  \section{Fault elements}
    \begin{fenumerate}\item
  Unless the provision specifies to the contrary,  all offences under this Code have no fault elements. In particular, it is not a sufficient defence to a charge that the accused had no intention or knowledge of an element thereof.
  \end{fenumerate}
  \section{Absolute liability}%\phantom{.}
  %
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[] \hypertarget{Absolute liability}
  If a provision of this Code creates an offence and provides that the offence or an element of it is one of \defi{absolute liability} then there are no fault elements and the defence of mistake of fact is unavailable.
  \end{enumerate}
  \section{Attempts}
  \begin{fenumerate}
    \item If a provision of this Code makes an offence it is also an offence to attempt to commit that offence.

    And the penalty for attempting an offence is the penalty that would have been imposed had the attempt been successful.
  \end{fenumerate}
  \section{Joint and vicarious liability for offences}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The members of a \squad, the members of a \team, and the members of a \residence\ are jointly responsible for their conduct.
    \item If a provision of this Code that makes an offence proscribes conduct by a \team's \competitor s, the \Referee\ does not have to specify which \competitor\ was responsible for the conduct in order to prove the guilt of the \team\ if it can be established one of the \team's \competitor s was responsible for the conduct.
    \item A \residence\ is vicariously responsible for the conduct of its \spectator s, its \Coach, and its \President. A penalty of disqualification that is applicable to a future \team, \squad, or \residence, (as a consecutive penalty) is to be taken as prohibiting the entry of that \residence\ in a Division or the event for the subsequent year.
  \item A penalty against a \squad\ or \residence\ is to be applied to every \team\ in the \squad.

  \end{enumerate}
  \section{Maximum penalty}
  \begin{enumerate} \item
  Where a provision of this Code makes an offence, the penalty written thereafter is to be read as the maximum penalty available for that offence.
  \item If a provision of this Code makes an offence but does not specify a penalty, the maximum penalty is the disqualification of the affiliated residence for both the event in which the offence either took place or was most closely associated with and in the event in the subsequent year. This penalty is to be reserved for conduct falling into the worst category.
  \item If a \residence\ or the members thereof are guilty of two or more offences that deserve penalties, the penalties imposed may be combined or served consecutively if it is in the interests of justice to do so.
  \end{enumerate}
%  {\small In this section, \defi{affiliated residence} means the offending \residence\ or the \residence\ of the %\Captain\ who entered the offending \competitor, \team, or \squad, or the \residence\ of the \President\ of the %offending \spectator.}
  \section{Less severe penalties may be imposed}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If a breach is proved, a less severe penalty than the maximum penalty may be imposed.
    \item For all offences, the \Referee\ may warn or reprimand the accused \Captain\ or \President.
  \end{enumerate}
  \section{Some matters not relevant to the severity of a penalty}
  \begin{fenumerate}
    %\item A penalty, whether imposed by the \Referee\ or by the Tribunal, is to be imposed having regard only to %the nature of the offence.
    \item The following matters are irrelevant in deciding whether to impose a penalty or in determining the severity of a penalty:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item whether the result of the penalty would mean a change in the rank of the affiliated residence or \team\ whether in the event or in a wider competition of which Inward Bound is a part.
      \item whether the penalty would be particularly severe on a \Coach\ or \President.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{fenumerate}
  \section{Totality in multiple penalties}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If the \Referee\
       finds that a single \residence\ was responsible for multiple separate punishable offences, the \Referee\ shall impose a penalty,  exceeding neither  two consecutive disqualifications of the affiliated \residence\ nor the sum or union of the maximum penalties for the those offences, that reflects the totality of the offences committed, even if this exceeds the sum or union of the individual penalties that would have been imposed.

       \eg{if the \Referee\ finds that a residence has committed an offence with a maximum penalty of two consecutive disqualifications of the residence and an offence with a maximum penalty of disqualification of the team, the \Referee\ may impose a penalty of disqual\-ification of the squad and a penalty disqualifying the residence from the \team's Division in the subsequent event, even if the first offence only warranted one disqualification of the residence.}
    \item A decision to impose a penalty reflecting the totality of multiple offences shall prevail over any decision regarding one or a subset of the individual offences, even if the decision has been published, the Tribunal has made a ruling on it, or the \Referee\ took into account the totality of the offences in the subset.
  \end{enumerate}
  \chapter{Training}
  \section{Application of this Code to training}
